# st

This is a fork of the excellent [st](https://st.suckless.org/) terminal by
Suckless (most recently based on st-0.8.1). `st` is configured by forking and
applying appropriate patching and source modifications. This repository
constitutes my personal configuration of `st`.

## Changes From the Default:

* All [scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) patches have
  been applied.
* The colorscheme has been set to [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
* The font has been set to [gohufont](http://font.gohu.org/).
* The cursor has been configured to be a red I-beam style.
